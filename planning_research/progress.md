# Floor Plan AI Project Progress

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a custom AI pipeline to extract room areas and labels from floor plan images. The final goal is to process Dutch real estate listings from `funda.nl`. The core of the project involves training a custom semantic segmentation model (U-Net) and combining it with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for a complete, end-to-end solution. This approach was chosen to provide full control over the pipeline and to build a strong portfolio piece demonstrating deep learning skills.

### Training Implementation Details ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Simplified Approach**: 3-class segmentation (Background=0, Wall=1, Room=2) instead of 8 classes
- **Model**: U-Net with ResNet34 encoder (24.4M parameters)
- **Hardware**: RTX 2060 Super with 8GB VRAM (only using ~0.4GB currently)
- **Dataset**: 4,200 training samples, 400 validation samples
- **Training Speed**: ~2 seconds/iteration (can be optimized)

### Issues Encountered & Fixes Applied 🔧
- **Windows DataLoader Issue**: `num_workers=2` caused training to hang at 0% for 5+ minutes
  - **Fix**: Changed to `num_workers=0` for Windows compatibility
  - **Result**: Training now progresses normally
- **❌ Online Multiprocessing Fix Failed**: Found solution online using `if __name__ == '__main__':` protection
  - **Issue**: This only works for `.py` scripts, NOT Jupyter notebooks
  - **Result**: Training still hung with `num_workers=4`
  - **Final Fix**: ✅ Must use `num_workers=0` in Jupyter on Windows - no exceptions
- **GPU Memory Underutilization**: Only using 0.4GB out of 8GB available
  - **Current**: Batch size 4, could be increased to 8-12 for faster training
  - **GPU Utilization**: Currently low, can be improved with larger batches

### Current Training Status 🚀
- **Status**: Training active and progressing
- **Speed**: 2 seconds/iteration (1,050 batches per epoch)
- **GPU Usage**: 0.4GB / 2GB allocated (underutilized)
- **Next Optimization**: Increase batch size from 4 to 8+ for better GPU utilization

### CPU/GPU Load Balancing Experiments 🔬 **NEW**
**Problem Identified**: CPU spiking to 99% with alternating CPU/GPU usage pattern indicates data loading bottleneck.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **CPU Phase**: Loading 8 images, applying Albumentations transforms (rotation, flip, color jitter), tensor conversion
- **GPU Phase**: Forward pass, backward pass, weight updates
- **Pattern**: CPU→GPU→CPU→GPU (sequential, not overlapped)

**Optimization Strategy**: Step-by-step approach to shift load from CPU to GPU

**Experiment 1: Augmentation Impact Test** 🧪 
- **Hypothesis**: Data augmentations (Albumentations) are causing the 99% CPU spike
- **Test**: Temporarily disable `augment=True` → `augment=False` in training dataset
- **Expected Result**: Should reduce CPU load significantly if augmentations are the bottleneck
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅
- **Results**: 
  - ❌ CPU usage still hits 100% (augmentations NOT the main bottleneck)
  - ❌ ETA slightly slower (augmentations weren't causing slowdown)
- **Conclusion**: **Data loading itself is the bottleneck** (disk I/O, image decoding, tensor conversion)

**Experiment 2: Optimize Data Transfer Pipeline** 🚀 **NEXT**
- **Hypothesis**: CPU→GPU data transfer is inefficient, causing CPU to work harder
- **Test**: Enable `pin_memory=True` and `non_blocking=True` for faster transfers
- **Expected Result**: CPU can hand off data to GPU faster, reducing CPU wait time
- **Benefits**: 
  - `pin_memory`: Uses page-locked memory for 2x faster CPU→GPU transfers
  - `non_blocking`: CPU doesn't wait for GPU transfer to complete
- **Status**: **READY TO IMPLEMENT**

**Experiment 3: Shift Augmentations to GPU** 🎯 **NEXT**
- **Hypothesis**: Move augmentations from CPU (Albumentations) to GPU (Kornia) to balance load
- **Strategy**: Re-enable augmentations but run them on GPU instead of CPU
- **Expected Benefits**: 
  - CPU: Only handles disk I/O and basic tensor creation (less work)
  - GPU: Handles augmentations + model forward/backward (better utilization)
  - Better CPU/GPU load balancing
- **Target**: Get back to 3.6s/it or better by using GPU compute for augmentations
- **Status**: **READY TO IMPLEMENT**

### Windows DataLoader Fix Implemented ✅ **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**
**Issue**: Training notebook was hanging indefinitely due to Windows multiprocessing incompatibility

**Root Cause Discovered**: 
- The "online solution" using `if __name__ == '__main__':` **only works for Python scripts (.py files)**
- In Jupyter notebooks, `__name__` is never `'__main__'`, so the protection fails
- `num_workers > 0` causes infinite hanging in Windows Jupyter environments

**Complete Fix Applied**: 
1. ✅ **DataLoader Configuration**: Changed `num_workers=4` → `num_workers=0` 
2. ✅ **Removed Ineffective Protection**: Eliminated `if __name__ == '__main__':` check
3. ✅ **Direct Function Call**: Training now calls `train_model()` directly
4. ✅ **Documentation Updated**: Added clear Windows Jupyter compatibility notes

**Performance Optimizations Included**:
- ✅ `pin_memory=True` for faster CPU→GPU memory transfers
- ✅ `non_blocking=True` for overlapped data transfers  
- ✅ GPU augmentations (Kornia) for better CPU/GPU load balancing
- ✅ Granular GPU memory monitoring (every 10 batches)

**Notebook Status**: ✅ Ready to train successfully on Windows Jupyter

**Phase 2 Status:** 🔄 **READY FOR TRAINING** - All Windows compatibility issues resolved, optimizations applied

## Phase 3: Inference and Post-Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Build the inference script that takes a new floor plan image.
- [ ] Load the trained U-Net model and perform segmentation to get the `(wall, room)` mask.
- [ ] Isolate the room mask and apply `cv2.connectedComponents` to get individual room instances.
- [ ] **Scale Calibration:**
    - Use EasyOCR to find text labels on the image.
    - Use regex to find a dimension label (e.g., "5.2m").
    - Find the associated line with OpenCV and measure its pixel length to get a `meters/pixel` ratio.
- [ ] **Label Association:**
    - For each room instance mask, calculate its centroid.
    - Find the OCR'd text box that contains the centroid.
    - Assign that text as the room's label (e.g., "Woonkamer").
- [ ] **Area Calculation:**
    - For each instance mask, count its pixels.
    - Calculate the final area: `area_m2 = pixel_count * (scale_factor**2)`.
- [ ] Generate the final JSON output.

## Phase 4: Evaluation & Adaptation for Dutch Floor Plans
- [ ] Evaluate the full pipeline's accuracy on the CubiCasa5K test set.
- [ ] Collect a test set of at least 50 floor plans from `funda.nl`.
- [ ] Manually annotate these plans to create a ground truth for evaluation.
- [ ] Test the pipeline on the Dutch plans, specifically checking the OCR performance on Dutch text and the model's generalization.
- [ ] If needed, fine-tune the model on a small, annotated set of Dutch floor plans to improve performance.

**Phase 2 Status Update**: ✅ Windows DataLoader issue resolved - notebook should now train successfully with `num_workers=0`.

### Google Colab Optimization Created 🚀 **MAJOR SPEED BOOST**
**Created**: `train_simplified_unet_colab.py` and `colab_setup_instructions.md`

**Speed Improvement Expected**: 4-5x faster training vs Windows local setup
- **Local (Windows)**: ~37 min/epoch × 10 epochs = ~6.2 hours  
- **Colab (T4)**: ~8 min/epoch × 10 epochs = ~1.3 hours

**Key Colab Optimizations**:
1. ✅ **Dynamic GPU Detection**: Auto-detects T4/V100/A100 and optimizes batch size
2. ✅ **Multiple Workers**: Can use `num_workers=2-4` (vs 0 on Windows)
3. ✅ **Larger Batch Sizes**: 16-32 vs 8 locally (better GPU utilization)
4. ✅ **Better Hardware**: T4 (16GB) vs RTX 2060S (8GB)
5. ✅ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Learning rate scheduling, pixel accuracy, auto-checkpointing
6. ✅ **Google Drive Integration**: Automatic file upload/download workflow

**Files to Upload to Google Drive**:
- `cubicasa_dataset_v2.py` (your existing module)
- `dataset cubicasa/` folder (~2-3GB, main upload)
- `train_simplified_unet_colab.py` (the optimized script)

**Expected Results**: Complete 10 epochs in ~1-2 hours with better model performance due to larger batch sizes and optimized training pipeline.
