# Floor Plan AI Project Progress

## Project Overview
Building a Mask R-CNN model to extract room areas from floor plan images using the CubiCasa5K dataset, with final goal of processing Dutch real estate listings from funda.nl.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Dataset Preparation

- [x] Install dependencies (torch, torchvision, opencv-python-headless, easyocr) - PyTorch 2.7.1+cu118 ✓
- [x] ✅ ARCHITECTURE PIVOT: Switch to U-Net + connected components (no Detectron2 needed!)
- [x] Install segmentation-models-pytorch 0.5.0 ✓
- [x] Verify CubiCasa5K dataset structure and COCO annotation files ✓
- [x] Explore dataset splits: train.txt, val.txt, test.txt ✓
- [x] Analyze sample images from colorful/, high_quality/, and high_quality_architectural/ subsets ✓
- [x] Convert from instance-based to semantic segmentation approach ✓

## Phase 2: Data Analysis & Preprocessing  
- [ ] Examine COCO annotation format in train_coco_pt.json, val_coco_pt.json, test_coco_pt.json
- [ ] Analyze mask annotations and room categories
- [ ] Implement data augmentation pipeline (random flips, ±5° rotations, brightness/contrast jitter)
- [ ] Set up data loaders with proper preprocessing (resize to 1024×N, ImageNet normalization)
- [ ] Create validation strategy using high_quality data for training and colorful for generalization testing

## Phase 3: Model Architecture & Training
- [ ] Configure U-Net with ResNet34 encoder (via segmentation-models-pytorch)
- [ ] Set loss function: Dice or Cross-Entropy for "room vs. background" or multi-class
- [ ] Set hyperparameters: LR=0.002, batch_size=4/GPU, 20-30 epochs, LR step at epoch 15
- [ ] Implement PyTorch Dataset for (image, semantic_mask) pairs
- [ ] Implement training loop with proper validation monitoring
- [ ] Track IoU/Dice metrics on validation set
- [ ] Set up model checkpointing to save best performing model
- [ ] Monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters if needed

## Phase 4: Inference Pipeline Development
- [ ] Build image preprocessing module (resize, normalize)
- [ ] Create semantic segmentation pipeline using trained U-Net
- [ ] Implement connected components analysis to separate room instances
- [ ] Implement post-processing for mask refinement and blob separation
- [ ] Test inference on sample floor plan images
- [ ] Optimize inference speed and memory usage

## Phase 5: Scale Calibration System
- [ ] Integrate EasyOCR for text detection and recognition
- [ ] Implement regex pattern matching for dimension labels (\d+(\.\d+)?\s*[mM])
- [ ] Build contour detection system to find straight lines near dimension text
- [ ] Calculate pixel length measurement between contour endpoints
- [ ] Compute scale_factor = real_length_m / pixel_length_px
- [ ] Test calibration accuracy on various floor plan styles

## Phase 6: Room Association & Area Calculation
- [ ] Develop centroid calculation for room masks
- [ ] Implement text-to-room association algorithm (match OCR text boxes to mask centroids)
- [ ] Build area computation: area_m2 = mask_pixel_count × (scale_factor)²
- [ ] Handle edge cases (overlapping rooms, missing labels, multiple text per room)
- [ ] Validate area calculations against known measurements

## Phase 7: Integration & Output Generation
- [ ] Combine all pipeline components into unified system
- [ ] Implement JSON output format: [{"room":"Living Room","area_m2":19.7}, ...]
- [ ] Add error handling and logging throughout pipeline
- [ ] Create batch processing capability for multiple floor plans
- [ ] Optimize end-to-end processing time

## Phase 8: Evaluation & Testing
- [ ] Evaluate mask AP@0.5 on CubiCasa5K test split
- [ ] Create manual annotation set of 50 Dutch floor plans for area accuracy testing
- [ ] Measure area prediction error rates
- [ ] Test generalization on various floor plan styles and qualities
- [ ] Document performance metrics and limitations

## Phase 9: Dutch Real Estate Adaptation
- [ ] Collect sample floor plans from funda.nl
- [ ] Analyze style differences between CubiCasa5K and Dutch plans
- [ ] Fine-tune model on 100 in-domain Dutch examples if needed (5-10 epochs)
- [ ] Test pipeline on real funda.nl floor plan images
- [ ] Optimize for common Dutch floor plan conventions

## Phase 10: Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Package system into deployable module
- [ ] Create user documentation and API specifications
- [ ] Implement error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for production use
- [ ] Create demo interface for testing floor plan uploads
- [ ] Prepare for integration with funda.nl scraping system
